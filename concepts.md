Concepts list:

  * Linear - Logistic - Ridge - ElasticNet - Lasso - Polynomial regression
  * Panel regression (w/ and w/o random effects)
  * SVM
  * XGBoost - LightGBM - CatBoost
  * Ensembling - Stacking - Boosting - Bagging
  * Regularization
  * Bias-variance tradeoff - how to reduce either of them or both
  * Gradient Descent - online and batch 
  * Activation function - different types
  * Missing data imputation methods
  * Epoch - Learning rate 
  * Perceptron - Multi-layer feedforward neural network - CNN - RNN (LSTM, GRU)
  * Backpropagation mechanism
  * Why bias input of 1 in needed in neural network?
  * Loss function - different types of loss function
